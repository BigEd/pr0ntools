Better conservations of file types (ie not assume .jpg)
Photometric optimization improvements
	Might just need to disable optimizing other variables
Be able to handle manually taken images
	Creep along maybe, trying to map it out
	Scan row until a match failure
	Scan linearly again until all rows constructed
	Try to then estimate how many pictures in a row and fit them together
